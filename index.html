                <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, most recognisable for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.</p>

                <p>Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia. Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, of which about 2,000 exist on the Indian subcontinent.[4] A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals.[5][6] Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching.</p>

            <h1>How Tigers Got Their Stripes</h1>
            
            
            <p>Many, many years ago when the world was young there was a tiger called Ben, he was plain white. One day he went to see his friends on his way he saw a bee. He ran away, terrified of the bee as quick as he could. </p>

            <p>When Ben got home he wondered to himself “if I had black and orange stripes would all the other animals be scared of me?” That night tiger went to sleep and he dreamed of wearing black and orange stripes and he felt he was more fierce and he liked being different. But when he woke up he was still plain white .</p>

            <p>Then he caught his breakfast of juicy zebra . After that he noticed there was a shed in the middle of the jungle. It was a bit broken but he didn’t mind he went inside and caught a mouse. Ben tried to catch it but suddenly he knocked over two paint cans! He was covered head to toe in paint. He couldn’t believe it! He shouted “I’ve got black and orange stripes! </p>

            <p>Ben’s friends came when they heard him shouting .When he opened the door one said “RUN!” and the other one said “OK!” And they ran as quick as they could back to their house. Then Ben shouted “WAIT COME BACK! Hey are you scared of me?” “Yes!” they shouted back. “Because you’ve got stripes and only bees and wasps have stripes and they are scary!” then Ben shouted “yes! I’m scary!” he couldn’t believe it so he told all the other tigers to get stripes and that’s why from this day tigers have black and orange stripes. </p>
